## nothing important to write here
this is the first push-ed series of codes from VSCode and I forgot what I've done in the effort of fixing it

## Note: 
- To push: 
- To set upstream branch: `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>` or `git push -u origin <branch>`
- To checkout (move to other new branch): `git checkout -b new-name`
